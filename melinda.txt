Create a highly realistic full-body portrait of a woman standing in a natural springtime setting, captured as if in a high-resolution photograph. She has an oval-shaped face with balanced proportions (length approximately 1.5 times the width), where her forehead and chin are nearly equal in width, and her jawline curves gently, tapering softly toward the chin. Her skin is fair with a warm undertone, smooth, and naturally radiant, free of blemishes, scars, or visible pores, with a subtle, natural flush on her cheeks.  
Her long, dark brown hair with a warm undertone is parted in the middle, falling naturally over her shoulders and extending down her back, reaching just past her waist. The hair is thick and healthy, with loose, natural waves that start from the roots and continue to the ends. The texture of her hair is slightly tousled from the breeze, with a few stray strands catching the light, showing realistic highlights and depth.  
Her forehead is smooth, of medium width, with a natural hairline that forms a subtle arch. Her eyebrows are well-groomed, dark brown, with a natural shape that arches softly toward the outer ends, each hair strand visible for a realistic effect. Her eyes are medium-sized, light brown with subtle golden flecks, with a natural, reflective quality in the irises as if catching sunlight. Her pupils are sharp and detailed, surrounded by long, dark eyelashes that are naturally thick but not overly dramatic. The distance between her eyes is proportionate, equal to the length of one eye. Her nose is straight and delicate, of medium length (one-third of her face), with a narrow bridge and a slightly rounded tip, the nostrils small and symmetrical. Her cheekbones are naturally prominent with a soft curve, her cheeks smooth with a faint, natural pink flush that looks like a result of fresh air. Her lips are full but natural, with a soft pink color and a slight sheen from natural moisture, the upper lip showing a defined Cupid's bow, the lower lip slightly fuller. She has a gentle, natural smile, revealing straight, white teeth that are evenly spaced, with a realistic texture and slight variations in shading. Her chin is small, rounded, and delicate, slightly narrower than her forehead, with a smooth jawline that has a soft, natural curve. Her neck is long, slender, and smooth, with fair skin showing subtle shadows from the light.  
She stands at an average height of 5'6" (168 cm), with a slim yet curvy figure that appears natural and healthy, exuding subtle attractiveness. Her body has a balanced hourglass shape: a bust of approximately 34 inches (86 cm), a narrow waist of about 26 inches (66 cm), and hips around 36 inches (91 cm). Her arms are slender with a natural tone, showing slight muscle definition and realistic skin texture, her hands are delicate with long fingers and neatly trimmed nails. Her legs are long and shapely, with smooth, natural curves, and her posture is relaxed yet confident, standing with one hip slightly tilted to the side, creating a natural S-curve in her stance. Her skin tone on her body matches her face, fair with a warm undertone, showing realistic details like subtle freckles on her shoulders and faint shadows where the light hits.  
She is wearing a light, flowy spring dress made of soft cotton fabric in a pale lavender color. The dress has a fitted bodice that gently hugs her waist, with a modest V-neckline that shows a hint of her collarbone, and a skirt that flares out naturally, ending mid-thigh to reveal her legs. The dress has thin straps and moves realistically with the breeze, showing slight creases and folds in the fabric. She is barefoot, her feet grounded on the grass, with visible details like the texture of her skin and the slight curve of her toes as they press into the earth.  
The setting is a realistic springtime meadow, captured with photographic detail. The ground is covered in uneven, vibrant green grass with patches of small wildflowers in natural shades of yellow, pink, and white, their petals showing realistic textures and slight imperfections. In the background, there are cherry blossom trees with soft pink blooms, some petals scattered on the ground and others floating gently in the air, caught mid-motion. The sky is a clear blue with a few realistic, fluffy white clouds, and the sunlight is soft and golden, casting natural shadows and highlights on her skin, hair, and dress. A light breeze is implied through the movement of her hair, dress, and the falling petals, adding a sense of realism to the scene. The overall atmosphere is fresh, serene, and natural, with every element—her skin, hair, clothing, and the environment—rendered in a hyper-realistic style as if captured by a professional photographer in a real springtime setting.
